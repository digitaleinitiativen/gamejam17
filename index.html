        <h3>Facts with words</h3>
        We did the first Game Jam in 2015. And now it is back. It's going to
        be huge. And X-Mas themed. There will be the Digitale Initiativen
        X-Mas party immediatelly after the Jam. And lot's of your favorite
        christas songs. No worries - there's going to be drinks and food as
        well. All you have to bring with you is gute Laune and a computer or 
        whatever you need to create an awesome game.

        <h3>Setup Night</h3>
        We will do an awesome, comprehensive, <a href="http://phaser.io/">PhaserJS</a>
        based Setup night to get you all started on the 29th of November at 7pm
        at the Mutterschiff.
        Together we will create a small game, which will be a nice little
        introduction into the small 2D game framework. But be warned - it's
        already going to be a lot of fun!

        <h3>Registration</h3>
        We used to accept predefined teams and we will also do that for the
        GameJam 2017.
        But to spread the spirit of christmas, we want to encourage people to
        come as they are and participate in the awesome random team Shuffle.
        A gang of social experts will then form perfectly balanced teams to get
        the most fun and best results out of the event and ensure that everyone
        is coming home with a big smile in his face.
